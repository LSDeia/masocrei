# Masocrei

Masocrei is a little cli-tool to cypher message like kids (zero security).

## ðŸš§ Note

This is a little project so i will finish it when i have time.

## Concept

Masocrei use embraced rythmes principles to move letter in the message and leave it unreadable (almost).

The string "bugs" will be interpreted like "BAAB", and masocrei output will be "AABB" -> "ugbs"# Masocrei

## History

maybe i will explain one day.
